# GenAI Vibe Coding Lab

Welcome to the GenAI Vibe Coding Lab! This project provides a complete, portable, and ready-to-use development environment in a virtual machine. It's perfect for anyone who wants a consistent and isolated workspace packed with the latest AI-powered coding tools, without cluttering up their main computer.

With a single command, you can launch a Debian "Bookworm" Linux environment that comes pre-installed with everything you need to start experimenting with AI in your coding workflow.

The lab is accessible directly from your web browser via VS Code, providing a familiar and powerful editing experience out of the box.

## Features

* **One-Command Setup**: Run `vagrant up` to build and configure your entire environment automatically.
* **Browser-Based IDE**: Access a full VS Code interface in your browser, running on the VM. It even opens this README on first launch!
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linuxâ€”anywhere you can run Vagrant.
* **AI-Powered Tools Pre-installed**:
  * **Aider**: Chat with AI and edit code right from the terminal.
  * **Claude Code**: A command-line tool for interacting with Anthropic's Claude model.
  * **Crush**: An intelligent command-line tool that uses AI to generate shell commands from plain English.
* **Modern Development Utilities**:
  * **asdf**: Manage multiple versions of runtimes like Node.js, Python, etc.
  * **direnv**: Automatically load environment variables on a per-project basis.
  * **Goose**: A powerful tool for managing database migrations.
* **Nested Virtualization**: Enabled by default, so you can run tools like Docker or Minikube inside the VM.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must install two pieces of software on your host machine
(your main computer).

1. **A Virtualization Provider:** Vagrant uses a "provider"
   to run the virtual machine. You only need to install
   **one** of the following:
   * [**Oracle VirtualBox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (Free,
     recommended for beginners)
   * [**VMWare
     Workstation**](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) /
     [**Fusion**](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) (Commercial)   * [**Libvirt / KVM**](https://libvirt.org/) (Free, best performances for Linux hosts)

2. **Vagrant:** This is the tool that reads the project
   files and automates the VM setup.
   * [**Download Vagrant**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads)

## Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Get the Project Files

You need the project files on your computer. If you have Git installed, clone the repository. Otherwise, download the files as a ZIP and extract them to a folder.

```bash
# Example using Git
git clone https://code.apps.glenux.net/glenux/gen-ai--vibe-coding--lab
cd gen-ai--vibe-coding--lab
```

### 2. Start the Virtual Machine

Navigate into the project directory (where the `Vagrantfile` is located) in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

**What's happening in the background?**

* Vagrant downloads a base Debian Linux image (this only happens once).
* It creates a new virtual machine.
* It boots the VM and runs the `provision.sh` script to install all the tools, including VS Code for the web, Aider, and more.

This first launch can take 5-15 minutes, depending on your internet speed. Subsequent startups will be much faster.

### Step 3: Access Your Coding Lab

Once `vagrant up` is finished, your AI Coding Lab is running! You have two ways to access it:

#### Option A: In Your Browser (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started. Open your favorite web browser and go to:

**<http://localhost:8080>**

You will see a complete VS Code interface running, ready to use. The project folder is open, and this `README.md` file will be displayed automatically. There is no password required.

#### Option B: In Your Terminal (Advanced)

If you prefer a traditional command-line interface, you can connect to the VM using SSH with a simple Vagrant command:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

You are now logged into the Debian VM. The project directory on your computer is synchronized with the `/vagrant` directory inside the VM.

## Basic Vagrant Workflow

Here are the most common commands you'll use:

* `vagrant up`: Starts the VM and provisions it on the first run.
* `vagrant ssh`: Connects to the VM's terminal.
* `vagrant provision`: Re-runs the installation script on an already running VM.
* `vagrant halt`: Shuts down the VM gracefully. Run `vagrant up` again to restart it quickly.
* `vagrant destroy -f`: **Deletes the VM completely.** All data inside the VM (outside the shared `/vagrant` folder) will be lost.
* `vagrant status`: Shows the current state of the VM (e.g., running, off).
